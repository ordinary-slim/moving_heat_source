Moving heat sources using FEM

To-do:
------
- [ ] Add interpolartion option for External methods
- [x] Add named arguments for interpolate methods
- [x] It seems only one thing left. Figure out why power is low
- [ ] Remove setValues methods (unused, unoptimized)
- [x] Reduce code duplication in Function class (inteprolate methods)
- [ ] Include path
- [x] What's happening in back of subdomain ?
- [ ] 10 layer example 2d printing
- [ ] Cleanup lumped heat source
- [ ] Move project method away from Problem class
- [x] Interface with gmsh (kindoff)
- [ ] Interface with PyMesh
- [x] Refactoring computation mass matrix (URGENT)
- [ ] Determine if mass matrix is computed or not
- [ ] Sync getEnts from ActiveMesh and Mesh
- [ ] Sync the getFacetVertexSets implementations
- [ ] Cleanup CMAKE so that I dont have to link with Qt5
- [ ] Add default OBB constructor
- [ ] Reduce number of tags in ActiveMesh
- [ ] Remove elsOwnedByOther
- [ ] neumannFluxes ?
- [ ] Undefined behaviour if activation && weakBcFacets not updated
- [ ] Refactor gammaFacets into weakBcFacets?

Ideas:
------
- Move FRF stuff to domain instead of mesh
- Privatize more
- Timer object
- Move down intersection to domain level
Difficult because ActiveNodes interpolation relies on
FEM Function which ActiveMesh does not know aobut
