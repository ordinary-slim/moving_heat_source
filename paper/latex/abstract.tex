This paper presents a framework to simulate the partscale deposition
process in metallic AM using a Domain Decomposition approach.
The domain close to the heat source is posed in the reference
frame of the heat source and far from it in the laboratory
reference frame. This method helps the modeller to tackle the
temporal multiscale nature of the process.
