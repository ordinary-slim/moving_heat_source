This paper presents a framework to solve for
the thermal field in the partscale deposition
process in metallic Additive Manufacturing
using a Domain Decomposition approach.
Close to the laser, the heat equation is posed
in the reference
frame of the heat source,
and the rest of the domain is solved
for in the laboratory reference frame.
This work focuses on the temporal multiscale
nature of the problem. Notably, the constraint
of timestepping less than a radius per time step
is absent in this model. The steadiness
of the problem in the reference frame of the heat source
is taken advantage from in order to take bigger time steps
and time savings of around $\times 2-3$ are showcased
in an example case with deposition.
