abstract = {The current work reports the result of investigations into alternative representations of the temporal evolution of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. In order to provide the reader with sufficient context for the following discussion, the modeling challenge and its underlying cause, as well as current attempts to provide a satisfactory solution, will be discussed. Next, the author will describe two numerical methods (multirate time integration and parallel-in-time) to better represent the temporal scales of the problem. Finally, the results of applying these methods to a two-dimensional version of the heat transfer portion of the LPBF problem will be presented, reporting on both convergence and performance behavior, which indicate the possibility of significant speedup of solution calculations (40–100 times), along with well-characterized effects on solution accuracy.}

abstract = {Finite element simulation of the laser powder bed fusion process is made challenging by the inherently multiscale nature of the process. When using the typical global time stepping techniques, slowly-evolving regions of the domain receive the same numerical treatment as the regions with the highest temperature rates. The current work details the implementation and evaluation of an implicit multirate method which is able to advance different regions of the domain with distinct time steps, depending on their current solution rate. Previous work indicates that this representation of the temporal scales of the problem can lead to significant reductions in wall clock run time, and it is shown herein that multirate time integration, when used with a uniform process-scale mesh, can result in speedups of approximately 19, 42, and 87 times, for domains with edge lengths of approximately 1 mm, 2 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. When used in conjunction with h-refinement (limited to two levels of refinement), the resulting speedups (taken relative to the uniform mesh) are around 28, 85, and 665 times. The method is demonstrated to converge as indicated by the literature, and its use with an AM-Bench domain is demonstrated.}

abstract = {Numerical simulation of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) procedure for additive manufacturing (AM) is difficult due to the presence of multiple scales in both time and space, ranging from the part scale (order of centimeters/seconds) to the powder scale (order of microns/milliseconds). This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the regions of small-scale behavior are not fixed, but change in time as the geometry is produced. While much work in recent years has been focused on resolving the problem of multiple scales in space, there has been less work done on multiscale approaches for the temporal discretization of LPBF problems. In the present contribution, we extend on a previously introduced two-level method in space by combining it with a multiscale time integration method. The unique transfer of information through the transmission conditions allows for interaction between the space and time scales while reducing computational costs. At the same time, all of the advantages of the two-level method in space (namely its geometrical flexibility and the ease in which one may deploy structured, uniform meshes) remain intact. Adopting the proposed multiscale time integration scheme, we observe a computational speed-up by a factor ×2.44 compared to the same two-level approach with uniform time integration, when simulating a laser source traveling on a bare plate of nickel-based superalloy material following an alternating scan path of fifty laser tracks.}

abstract = {Scan pattern dependent (multi-track) residual stress buildup over multiple layers in the powder bed fusion process is governed by coupled thermo-mechanics. The high computational cost associated with these simulations has resulted in the general adoption of approximate computational methods. The numerical or thermo-mechanical accuracy of assumptions made in these computational methods is not fully characterized. If benchmark multi-track simulations for small size multi-layer parts are available, including temperatures, strain fields and deformation results, it will be possible to scientifically develop new approximation schemes or modify existing ones to improve their accuracy. Present work develops a suggestive benchmark using full multi-track thermomechanical simulations, with comparison to various approximate methods. The target configurations are simple prismatic geometries with 30 layers and up to 120 mm3 volume, illustrating the influence of domain size on the approximate results. Anticipating the future challenges of measuring stresses and deformation in these small benchmark geometries, an experimental setup based on sheet metal forming principals is demonstrated numerically. The proposed setup will provide a methodology to experimentally validate these benchmarks.}

abstract = { An improved computational analysis is presented for the detailed prediction of heat transfer, phase change, and fluid flow during welding with a moving heat source. The governing equations are formulated in a reference frame attached to the heat source. A special feature in the formulation is that the primary unknown velocity is the convective velocity of the fluid with the motion of the heat source, resulting in additional source terms in the equations. The equations are solved using a control-volume-based computational method. The temperature and velocity fields and the time-temperature data are presented for two welding velocities to demonstrate the results using the new technique. }

abstract = {Problems with moving sources and moving inner boundaries in transient regime are of high interest in many research fields and engineering applications. One approach to properly tackle such problems is based on the Chimera method for non-matching grids, where each moving object is defined on a fine mesh that moves across the fixed coarse background. In this way, the high gradients around moving sources or boundaries are captured by the fine mesh without need of globally fine fixed meshes or adaptive refinement. In this work, Chimera is implemented in the framework of the finite element method, following an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation for the moving meshes and a standard Eulerian formulation for the fixed background mesh. Further, in case of convection-dominated problems, the scheme is stabilized using the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin method. The coupling between the moving fine meshes and the coarse fixed one is achieved via Dirichlet boundary conditions and a high-order interpolation algorithm. The performance of the proposed methodology in terms of accuracy and stability is assessed by means of numerical tests to be compared with equivalent problems solved using fixed meshes. Further tests serve to highlight the good performance of the proposed Chimera-based finite element method to address both convection-dominated problems with multiple moving boundaries and sources, and three-dimensional arc welding processes.}

In this paper, the analytical solution for a uniform heat source is derived from the solution of an instantaneous point heat source. The result is evaluated numerically and is compared to existing solutions for the moving point source and a semi-ellipsoidal source. Next, the result is used to demonstrate how such model can be used to study the effect of the heat source geometry. Besides, this solution reveals that a melting efficiency higher than 0.37 (=1/e, a maximum value stated by Rykalin [N. Rykalin, A. Uglov, A. Kokora, O. Glebov, Laser Machining and Welding, Mir Publishers, Moscow, 1978]) can be obtained. To investigate the effect of the temperature dependence of the material parameters, in particular the latent heat of fusion, a finite difference model is implemented. It is shown that the enthalpy method is most suited to implement the latent heat of fusion. A numerical evaluation for Ti–6Al–4V, reveals that the effect of the latent heat is rather small, except when the conductivity is very low, e.g. when scanning in a loose powder bed. The results demonstrate that analytical and numerical solutions can be effectively used to calculate the temperature distribution in a semi-infinite medium for finite 3D heat sources. In this way, a tool to investigate the importance of different processing parameters in laser manufacturing is obtained.}

abstract = {This paper describes the formulation adopted for the numerical simulation of the shaped metal deposition process (SMD) and the experimental work carried out at ITP Industry to calibrate and validate the proposed model. The SMD process is a novel manufacturing technology, similar to the multi-pass welding used for building features such as lugs and flanges on fabricated components (see Fig. 1a and b). A fully coupled thermo-mechanical solution is adopted including phase-change phenomena defined in terms of both latent heat release and shrinkage effects. Temperature evolution as well as residual stresses and distortions, due to the successive welding layers deposited, are accurately simulated coupling the heat transfer and the mechanical analysis. The material behavior is characterized by a thermo-elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model coupled with a metallurgical model. Nickel super-alloy 718 is the target material of this work. Both heat convection and heat radiation models are introduced to dissipate heat through the boundaries of the component. An in-house coupled FE software is used to deal with the numerical simulation and an ad-hoc activation methodology is formulated to simulate the deposition of the different layers of filler material. Difficulties and simplifying hypotheses are discussed. Thermo-mechanical results are presented in terms of both temperature evolution and distortions, and compared with the experimental data obtained at the SMD laboratory of ITP.}

abstract = {A stabilized finite element method for solving systems of convection–diffusion-reaction equations is studied in this paper. The method is based on the subgrid scale approach and an algebraic approximation to the subscales. After presenting the formulation of the method, it is analyzed how it behaves under changes of variables, showing that it relies on the law of change of the matrix of stabilization parameters associated to the method. An expression for this matrix is proposed for the case of general coupled systems of equations that is an extension of the expression proposed for a one-dimensional (1D) model problem. Applications of the stabilization technique to the Stokes problem with convection and to the bending of Reissner–Mindlin plates are discussed next. The design of the matrix of stabilization parameters is based on the identification of the stability deficiencies of the standard Galerkin method applied to these two problems.}
